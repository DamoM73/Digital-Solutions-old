With his mom's illness getting worse again, Max needs to figure out a way to save his family--now more than ever. So Max and his cousin Alex revisit The Lost Treasures, and they find a clue that just might be the key to a cure. It's the story of Verne's seemingly impossible recovery from a near-fatal gunshot wound. Somehow, after being shot, Verne didn't just survive, he thrived. And the book hints that he was only able to do so after collecting magical healing elements that he'd saved from a race around the world.

The nightly news frequently broadcasts images of activists rallying for social change on diverse issues ranging from animal rights to coal mines, gay marriage, religious freedom and alt-right anti-immigration views. Social change movements are increasingly championed online through social media and e-petitions as well as on the streets, placing pressure on politicians and raising the public profile of a range of causes. Anti-protest laws, expanded police powers, and political disapproval towards electoral activism, chaotic vegan protests and mass climate change action by school students, have all directed a spotlight on the principles of protest and the role of activist groups in organising resistance and raising awareness of controversial causes. This brand new topic examines protest movements, rights and protections, and explores how activism can influence public opinion and hold governments and business accountable. Is the current climate of protest growing hotter for social change?

Put simply, AI is a computer system that can do tasks that humans need intelligence to do. AI is already transforming the way we live, work, communicate and travel. From the development of driverless cars, to the machine learning and algorithms that power our mobile phones, voice-activated assistants and the internet of things, we are already co-existing and engaging with AI-enabled technology. However, along with the potential to improve our quality of life, AI risks compromising basic human rights and freedoms. We all need to better understand how AI is being developed, used and regulated as it becomes more embedded and empowered in the world around us. What is artificial intelligence, how does it work, and what are the benefits and ethical concerns? The robot revolution is happening right now - how much do you really know about the impacts of AI on your everyday life?",1266384,,006.3 ART,60 pages : colour illustrations.,,,,,,9.78192E+12,,,,,"Thirroul, NSW",2020,2020,,edited by Justin Healey.,,Artificial intelligence,,,,,Monograph,text,,,,,"Healey, Justin",,Spinney Press,Issues in society; 450,"Artificial intelligenceRobots",,,"Summary: Fifteen-year-old Peak Marcello is invited to climb Hkakabo Razi, one of the most isolated mountains in the world, but getting there involves a four-week trek through a tropical rainforest that is rife with hazards, which turns out to be more dangerous than summiting the mountain itself.",1231666,,MF SMI,228 pages.,,,,,,9.78054E+12,,,,,Boston,2018,2018,,Roland Smith.,,Ascent #3,,,,,Monograph,text,,,,,"Smith, Roland",,HMH Books for Young Readers,"A Peak Marcello adventure; 3Peak Marcello adventure; 3","Mountaineering - FictionSurvival - FictionRainforests - FictionMountaineeringSurvivalRainforestsFictionHkakabo Razi (Myanmar) - FictionMyanmar - Fiction",,,"Summary: In the year 2063, interstellar space travel has become the norm.

Consumer preferences are also changing as we seek greater independence and control over our electricity supply through smart meters, solar panels, battery storage and electric vehicles. Most of Australia's energy supply still heavily relies on its traditional, non-renewable resources of coal, oil and gas - yet Australia has plentiful clean energy renewable resources including solar, wind, geothermal, bioenergy, wave and tidal power. We also have the world's largest reserves of uranium to rely on - should we ever decide to choose controversial nuclear power as part of our energy mix. A secure supply of affordable, reliable and environmentally sustainable energy is essential to the nation's future growth and prosperity. What are the pros and cons of Australia's various energy options? Are we adapting quickly enough to renewables or clinging too long to fossil fuels, at a time when other advanced economies are leaving non-renewables behind to counter the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change?

The way the ocean operates is different to how we thought of it 100 years ago. We can no longer think of it as a place of limitless resources, a dumping ground, immune to change or decline.BLUE takes us on a provocative journey into the ocean realm, witnessing a critical moment in time when the marine world is on a precipice. Featuring passionate advocates for ocean preservation, BLUE takes us into their world where the story of our changing ocean is unfolding. We meet those who are defending habitats, campaigning for smarter fishing, combating marine pollution and fighting for the protection of keystone species.This feature documentary comes at a time when we are making critical decisions that will decide the legacy we leave for generations to come.

When explosions ripped through the reactor in rural Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, they spewed huge amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere and caused the worst nuclear disaster in history.

Humans depend on forests for shelter, the food we eat, the air we breathe and the wood products we use. Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for people, forests also protect biodiversity, prevent soil erosion and help to mitigate climate change. Global deforestation and forest degradation is a great problem requiring greater action. This book looks at the current state of the world's forests and progress towards more sustainable forest conservation globally. It also focuses on how Australia is managing and conserving its own native forests, with topics including forestry protection policies; tree-clearing and logging practices; the debate over native forest logging, including old growth forests; sustainable forestry practices, plantations and certification; and addressing habitat destruction and species loss.

In 1953 the pair was racing toward solving the mystery of DNA's structure before other scientists could beat them to it. They and others believed that finding the simple structure of the DNA molecule would answer a great mystery, how do organisms live, grow, develop, and survive, generation after generation?

One hundred techniques and practices are described here--some are well known; some you may have never heard of. They range from clean energy to educating girls in lower-income countries to land use practices that pull carbon out of the air. The solutions exist, are economically viable, and communities throughout the world are currently enacting them with skill and determination. If deployed collectively on a global scale over the next thirty years, they represent a credible path forward, not just to slow the earth's warming but to reach drawdown, that point in time when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere peak and begin to decline. These measures promise cascading benefits to human health, security, prosperity, and well-being--giving us every reason to see this planetary crisis as an opportunity to create a just and livable world.

The focus is on the prevention of harm, rather than on the prevention of drug use itself. Harm reduction has been a principle of Australia's approach to drug use for several decades. However, recent overdose deaths and hospitalisations at music festivals have highlighted the clear harms of illicit drug use and prompted a debate over the introduction of pill testing, with political leaders being reluctant to implement the measure. This book explores the ethical, legal and medical pros and cons in the debate, with a topical focus on pill testing. Does pill testing give young people a false sense of security and promote further risky drug use, when there is really no safe level at which these substances can be taken? Or are harm reduction approaches such as pill testing and needle and syringe programs simply about saving lives and giving people a safety net? In a perfect world, no one would risk their lives by taking party drugs - but in reality, is harm reduction too bitter a pill to swallow?",1266381,,362.29 DRU,60 pages : colour illustrations.,,,,,,9.78192E+12,,,,,"Thirroul, NSW",2020,2020,,edited by Justin Healey.,,Drug use and harm reduction,,,,,Monograph,text,,,,,"Healey, Justin",,Spinney Press,Issues in society; 453,"Drug abuseDrug abuse - TestingDrug abuse - Safety measuresDrugs",,,Summary: Father Duck plays a trick on a prying dog as a way of protecting his newborn ducklings.,1231777,,HR 9: RAN,16 pages : colour illustrations.,,,New edition.,,,9.78017E+12,,,"Reading age: 05, 05.5 and 06.",,"Southbank, Vic.",2017,2017,,story by Beverley Randell ; illustrations by Trevor Ruth.,,The duck with the broken wing,,,,,Monograph,text,,,,,"Randell, BeverleyRuth, Trevor",,Cengage Learning Australia,"PM library.

The information on each individual species is presented in small 'bites' to hold the interest of younger readers, while the information taken in total gives a comprehensive summary of each species, including breeding and feeding habits, physical characteristics, habitat and other unique and quirky features. Fauna also has a strong conservation message with an 'extinction roll call' and a rating for the vulnerability of endangered species.

A treasure that can save his house--and maybe his entire family. But Max and Alex aren't the only ones who know about Verne's clues. Spencer Niemend, a strange skunk-haired man who has spent his life researching Verne's works, is bent on reshaping the world with the hidden treasure.

What are the many ways in which we can reduce our own food waste? How can Australia address the needs of people who are food insecure, and by the same token minimise food waste, to encourage an equitable and sustainable approach to food?

More than 790 million people live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. Why is there still so much poverty in the world; how is it measured; and what is being done by way of trade, debt relief and aid to achieve the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere? By contrast, many around the world have never had it so good. Global income and wealth inequality is on the rise: 82% of the wealth generated last year went to the richest 1% of the global population, while the poorest half of the world's people saw no increase in their wealth. Just eight men own the same wealth as half the world. What are the causes of this staggering inequality, and how can we achieve the UN's Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries?

From the depths of myth an ancient enemy has returned: the Plague People, whose very presence obliterates whole villages; whose terror destroys minds. In their wake, nothing is left of the people, not their places, not their ways. On the plains, the warriors and the wise of all tribes gather to confront the aggressor. Loud Thunder leads his great war-host south, even as Tecumet and Asman head north with the Sun River army. With Maniye Many Tracks, they plan to forge a new unity between the tribes such as the world has never seen. Will it be enough to stave off an oblivion that might devour even their gods? Their adversary's presence is like a wound in the world, and wakes all the old terrors and evils from the peoples' stories.

Until recently, his biggest problems were the evil tutu-wearing sheepdog he met on Halloween and the arthritis in his own joints.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders make up 2% of all Australians, yet constitute 27% of the nation's prison population. Over-representation in the criminal justice system by indigenous men, women and young people is a persistent and growing problem. What are the reasons for these high imprisonment rates; and what reforms are being proposed to reduce indigenous people's contact with the criminal justice system? Are 'tough on crime' policies flouting death-in-custody recommendations and further entrenching indigenous inequality and disadvantage before the law? After the recent Royal Commission, prompted by shocking abuses at the Don Dale Detention Centre, has anything changed in relation to youth detention? This book examines the latest research on indigenous imprisonment rates, and reviews progress on addressing Aboriginal deaths in custody and youth detention reform. How can governments reduce over-incarceration and commit to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to implement overdue interventions?

Finally liberated by the fall of apartheid, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure into the dangers and opportunities of a new South Africa.

Curiosity's instruments collect data and its cameras take images of the Mars landscape, including self-portraits, in vivid color and detail.

Traditional masculine stereotypes persist in a culture which identifies men as self-reliant, emotionally reticent, focused on work over family, and oversexed. When these beliefs are taken to extreme levels by boys and men, they result in poor relationships, mental health problems and risky behaviours. Rethinking masculinity can help men and boys to move away from narrow masculine ideals and negative role models towards healthier, more diverse approaches to male identity. This book explores what it means to be a “a real man” in Australia, questioning the masculine stereotypes which sustain gender inequality. In addition, the book examines “toxic masculinity”, traditional male gender roles, misogyny and attitudes which promote violence and disrespect towards women. It also addresses the impacts of traditional masculine norms on men's health and wellbeing. What does it mean to be a man in a changing world - is there really a crisis in masculinity? How can society - and boys and men as individuals - encourage positive, healthier masculinities?",1266385,,305.31 MAS,60 pages : colour illustrations.,,,,,,9.78193E+12,,,,,"Thirroul, NSW",2020,2020,,edited by Justin Healey.,,Masculinity and male identity,,,,,Monograph,text,,,,,"Healey, Justin",,Spinney Press,Issues in society; 449,"MenSex role",,,Summary: In this book Suzie the Scientist helps us learn about materials used to build our houses.

Shigeo is an awkward but kind boy whose urge to help others and get along with them is bound up with the mental safety locks he's placed on his own emotions. Reigen knows he needs to exploit Shigeo to stay in business, yet for better or worse he's also his mentor and counselor. And he also knows whenever the normally repressed kid's emotions reach level 100, it may unleash more psychic energy than either of them can handle!",1211221,,MF MOB: ONE,188 pages : chiefly illustrations.,,,First English-language edition.,,,9.78151E+12,,,"At head of title: ONE presents.

This is the story of a creature who is both strange and unique. When he hatches down in the vast underground lair where monsters dwell, he looks just like a human boy, much to the disgust of everyone watching. Even the grumpy gargoyles who adopt him and nickname him Imp only want him to steal chocolate for them from the nearby shops. He's a child with feet in both worlds, and he doesn't know where he fits. But little does Imp realise that Thunderguts, king of the ogres, has a great and dangerous destiny in mind for him, and he'll stop at nothing to see it come to pass.

And any death that was sudden or suspicious would be investigated by the coroner. Henry Shiell was the Sydney City Coroner from 1866 to 1889. In the course of his unusually long career he delved into the lives, loves, crimes, homes and workplaces of colonial Sydneysiders. He learnt of envies, infidelities, passions, and loyalties, and just how short, sad and violent some lives were. But his court was also, at times, instrumental in calling for new laws and regulations to make life safer. Catie Gilchrist explores the nineteenth century city as a precarious place of bustling streets and rowdy hotels, harbourside wharves and dangerous industries. With few safety regulations, the colourful city was also a place of frequent inquests, silent morgues and solemn graveyards. This is the story of life and death in colonial Sydney.",1211109,,TR 994.402 GIL,400 pages : colour illustrations.,,,,,,9.78146E+12,,,,,Melbourne,2019,2019,,Catie Gilchrist.,,"Murder, misadventure & miserable ends : tales from a colonial coroner's court",,,,,Monograph,text,,,,,"Gilchrist, Catie",,HarperCollins,,"DeathMurderCriminal investigationAustralian historySydney (N.S.W.) - HistoryAustralia - History - 1851-1901",,,"Murder, misadventure and miserable endsTales from a colonial coroner's court""Summary: McGraw-Hill is revolutionizing the Music Appreciation course by introducing its first personalized digital learning experience with Roger Kamien's Music: An Appreciation.

After all, he was the first kid ever to live there. He knows its mysteries (none), its secrets (also none) and the best ways to have fun in it (climb a big tree and sit there). So why can't he answer newcomer Attica Stone's simple question: if the town's called Dunn's Orchard, where's the orchard? As Pri and Attica go in search of forbidden fruit, they uncover stranger mysteries: a robot caterpillar, a mayor with a murky past, a Possibly Real Actual Boogeyman and a house made of doors in a haunted wood. But what will Pri and Attica do when they discover the biggest secret of all - that something truly magical is about to be destroyed, and the only way to save it could be by destroying the town itself?",1211095,,PF LAR,320 pages.,,,,,,9.78176E+12,,,,,"Richmond, Vic",2018,2018,,Mat Larkin.,,The orchard underground,,,,,Monograph,text,,,,,"Larkin, Mat",,Hardie Grant Egmont,,"Trees - FictionCities and towns - FictionTreesTownsFiction",,,"Summary: Germany, 1939. After her mother is shot at a checkpoint, fifteen-year-old Sarah finds herself on the run from a government that wants to see her, along with every other Jew, dead. Then she meets a mysterious man who needs Sarah to pull off a spy mission he can't attempt on his own: infiltrate a boarding school attended by the daughters of Nazi top brass, befriend the girl whose father is a high-ranking scientist, and find the blueprints to a bomb that could destroy the cities of Western Europe. With years of training from her actress mother in the art of impersonation, Sarah thinks she's ready.

Most children exceed the recommended amount of screen-based activity time, while time spent sitting at leisure goes up in adults as they get older. Inactivity increases overweight and obesity, raising the risk of chronic and lifethreatening diseases like cardiovascular disease, dementia, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Regular physical activity not only reduces health risks, it improves social and emotional health and wellbeing. Which groups of inactive Australians are most at risk of lifestyle-related illness? What levels and types of activity are required for optimal health at each life stage, and how can we incorporate regular activity into our daily lives? This book explains the risks and consequences of physical inactivity, and in turn promotes the benefits of being active.

Making friends is impossible, since he doesn't speak English, and he's stuck looking after his little brother Yanghao. But Jingwen knows how to make everything better. If he can just make all of the cakes on the menu of the bakery his father had planned to open, and complete the dream he didn't have time to finish, then everything will be okay. Sure, he'll have to break his mother's most important rule about not using the oven when she's at work, keep his little brother from spilling his secret, and brush up on his baking skills, but some things are worth the risk.

Plastic is durable, cheap, light and can be flexible or rigid, with multiple uses - however plastic is also making the planet a victim of its own success. Plastic pollution has become an epidemic, afflicting land, waterways, coastlines and oceans. More than 8 million tonnes of plastic go into the world's oceans each year, killing marine life as it breaks down into billions of microplastic pieces, without decomposing. Consumption of plastic has increased exponentially, but while plastic and packaging recycling in Australia is well established, currently only 14% of plastic is recovered for recycling or energy recovery. How can we reduce the amount of plastic waste, increase recycling and minimise impacts on the environment? What are governments, industry, retailers and consumers doing to eliminate the use of plastic packaging including bags, bottles and containers to reduce landfill waste and ocean pollution? This book offers confronting facts on plastic use, but also features strategies aimed at tackling plastic pollution.

Pornography does not exist in a digital vacuum, but rather within a broader social context which reinforces sexual attitudes, beliefs and stereotypes about gender, sexism, sexual objectification, unsafe sexual health practices and violence-supportive attitudes. What are the impacts of porn? How do young people navigate the risks and realities of intended and accidental exposure to explicit content? This resource sensitively handles topics including 'sexting', image-based abuse, age verification, parental controls and communication with teens about pornography. The book explores interventions and initiatives aimed at educators, parents and young people to address the harms of pornography through promotion of online safety practices, critical thinking and discussion.

Yet, there is growing debate about the distribution of benefits from this growth, and the extent to which inequality is increasing. One in eight adults and more than one in six children are living in poverty, while the share of income going to the top is growing at the expense of low and middle-income earners. Inequality extends beyond income to educational, postcode, intergenerational and technological inequality - all of which are at the core of opportunity. How are poverty and inequality measured; what are the features of deprivation experienced by people living with entrenched economic disadvantage, struggling with rising costs of living and housing pressures, reliant on social security and charity? Is Australia, long seen as the land of the egalitarian 'fair go', now a divided nation of 'haves' and 'have-nots'?

Recent advancements in the use and availability of ART treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), gamete donation and surrogacy have raised numerous ethical considerations.

Now, any young girl who shows signs of being an Iaga is whisked away to Bleak Steppe -- to a life, so the story goes, of unspeakable punishment. When the bird army kidnaps Olga's sister in a surprise attack on the human kingdom, Olga realises she has to venture into the Republic of Birds to bring her back.

A Jedi must be a fearless warrior, a guardian of justice, and a scholar in the ways of the Force. But perhaps a Jedi's most essential duty is to pass on what they have learned. Master Yoda trained Dooku; Dooku trained Qui-Gon Jinn; and now Qui-Gon has a Padawan of his own. But while Qui-Gon has faced all manner of threats and danger as a Jedi, nothing has ever scared him like the thought of failing his apprentice. Obi-Wan Kenobi has deep respect for his Master, but struggles to understand him. Why must Qui-Gon so often disregard the laws that bind the Jedi? Why is Qui-Gon drawn to ancient Jedi prophecies instead of more practical concerns? And why wasn't Obi-Wan told that Qui-Gon is considering an invitation to join the Jedi Councilknowing it would mean the end of their partnership?

Acknowledging the wrongs of the past was a significant milestone in the history of our nation, but there is still much work to be done to heal the enduring trauma experienced by survivors, families and communities. After two decades, the majority of the Bringing Them Home recommendations have not been implemented, adding to ongoing distress. In the meantime, this inaction fails to address the escalating national crisis involving continuing removal of indigenous children from their families.

They met the people of the steppe, who welcomed Tim and Tigon into their homes, and shared their traditions and histories.

However, after Elysea mysteriously drowns, Tempest is forced to dive and scavenge alone, barely scraping by. But when she finds a real living green plant at her dive site, an item so rare it is almost priceless, she finally has the money to have all her questions answered -- by her dead sister. For the price of 3,000 notes, the research facility on the island of Palindromena will revive the departed for 24 hours before returning them to death. It is a time for the dead to make peace with the past and let the living move forward. Strong-willed Elysea has other plans. Convincing Tempest to break her out of the facility, they embark on a dangerous adventure to find out the truth about their supposedly deceased parents, the secret behind the revival process, and the true price for restored life.
